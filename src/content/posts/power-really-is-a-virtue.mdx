## Power and Virtue: Why We Need Both, and Why We're Afraid to Say So

The aphorism landed like a challenge (excuse the covert self-glazing):

<TwitterEmbed />

At first glance it feels wrong, even dangerous. In our cultural moment, power itself is suspect. We have built elaborate social mechanisms to shame those who hold it, as if power were its own moral indictment. But what if this reflexive suspicion is not virtue speaking, but its absence?

## The Two Halves of a Hard Truth

The first clause is easy to verify. History offers unlimited examples of power untethered from any moral anchor. The tyrant, the corporation that extracts while it pollutes, the manipulative partner who leverages emotional control: these demonstrate that power can exist as pure capacity, devoid of concern for justice or human flourishing. Power, in itself, is neutral. It is the ability to make things happen, to shape outcomes, to bend reality toward your will. It does not arrive with a conscience installed.

The second clause stings because it attacks our cherished separation between goodness and strength. But think about what virtue actually requires: the mother who needs to protect her child must have the power to do so, whether through legal knowledge, physical strength, or social support. The activist who would dismantle an unjust system needs more than righteous anger; they need strategy, funding, institutional savvy, and the power to endure retaliation. Even the simple act of keeping a promise demands power over your own impulses and circumstances. Virtue without the capacity to act remains trapped in intention, unable to touch the world. It is a seed without soil.

This creates an uncomfortable asymmetry. Power does not need virtue, but virtue desperately needs power. The implication is clear: if you care about goodness, you cannot afford to be indifferent to power. You must cultivate it, understand it, and refuse to surrender it to those who lack your scruples.

## Nietzsche's Ghost in the Machine

Friedrich Nietzsche saw this dynamic with terrible clarity. He distinguished between *master morality* and *slave morality*. Master morality, arising from the powerful, judged actions as good or bad based on their life-affirming qualities: nobility, strength, creativity. Slave morality, born from the ressentiment of the powerless, performed an ingenious inversion: it declared that the virtues of the strong were actually vices, and that meekness, humility, and self-denial were the true goods. The Biblical declaration "blessed are the meek" became not just consolation but a moral framework that sanctified powerlessness itself.

We live with the inheritance of slave morality. Our contemporary memeplexes, those self-replicating clusters of ideas that spread through culture, often treat power as original sin. The phrase "check your privilege" can be a call to awareness, but it frequently functions as a conversation-ending condemnation. The assumption that all billionaires are automatically unethical, or that leadership itself is oppressive, or that success must be stolen: these are not arguments but antibodies, designed to attack any concentration of power regardless of its character.

Nietzsche's concept of the *Übermensch*, the "overman," is often misunderstood as a call for domination. It is better read as a call for self-overcoming. The Übermensch is not the tyrant but the individual who creates his own values through rigorous self-mastery and offers them to the world. This requires immense power, not over others but over oneself: the power to transcend inherited morality, to bear the weight of freedom, to sculpt a life rather than merely endure it. The Übermensch does not reject power; he integrates it with creativity and discipline. He is the antidote to both ruthless ambition and impotent virtue.

## The Memeplex That Devours Its Own

I should admit I once embodied this memeplex myself. For years, I reflexively equated power with corruption and weakness with purity. I saw any ambition for influence as moral compromise, which felt like principle but functioned as surrender. This mindset did not make me virtuous; it made me irrelevant, leaving influence to those with fewer scruples about wielding it.

The problem with shaming power as such is that it does not eliminate power. It simply ensures that power will be held by those who are immune to shame. When good people are taught that seeking influence is corrupting, they abdicate the field. The result is not equality but a vacuum, filled by the shameless: the sociopath, the warlord, the algorithm that optimizes for engagement without a flicker of conscience.

This memeplex is particularly seductive because it feels like justice. It offers a simple heuristic: power bad, weakness virtuous. But this is a philosophical mirror trick. It confuses *power over others* with *capacity for good*, and in doing so, it strands virtue in a state of permanent helplessness. The activist who refuses to build institutions because institutions are "hierarchical" leaves the existing hierarchies untouched. The moralist who condemns all wealth while offering no path to sustainable abundance entrenches poverty. The progressive who attacks competence as "elitist" ensures that incompetence will rule.

Slave morality does not liberate. It reconciles the powerless to their condition by sanctifying it. It turns impotence into a virtue, which is perhaps the cruelest trick any ideology can play on those who seek change.

## Reclaiming Power for the Sake of Virtue

If we accept that virtue requires power, then the ethical imperative shifts. It is no longer enough to be pure; one must become capable. This demands what we might call *power literacy*: understanding systems, building institutions, mastering oneself, and learning to lead. It means refusing the comfortable story that the world is divided into victims and villains, and instead asking a harder question: how do we build structures where power flows toward those who serve the common good?

This is not a call to abandon critique. Unaccountable power remains dangerous. But critique must be paired with construction. Shame must be directed not at power itself but at its abuse. We need a new memeplex, one that recognizes that the most dangerous person in any room is not the one with power, but the one with power who has been taught that power is evil. That person will hide their influence, deny its existence, and use it without moral reflection.

## Toward an Integrated Ethic

The path forward is neither the ruthless will-to-power of the tyrant nor the self-canceling piety of the power-averse. It is the difficult middle: the cultivation of strength in service of something beyond the self. This is what Nietzsche was reaching for, however imperfectly. It is what every effective moral movement has understood, however quietly.

Your virtue is not measured by your distance from power but by what you do when you touch it. The question is not whether you have power, but whether you have the courage to admit it, the wisdom to wield it, and the humility to remain its servant.

The aphorism, in the end, is a call to grow up. It asks us to stop pretending that goodness can float free of consequence, and to stop pretending that power can be shamed out of existence. It asks us to become dangerous enough to be kind, strong enough to be just, and powerful enough to protect what we love.
