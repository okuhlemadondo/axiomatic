Post-Darwinian Frustrations, with David Pearce in the Room

I keep circling back to the same discomfort. Evolution explains a lot about how we move and think, but it explains almost nothing about what we ought to aim for. Natural selection is an account of survival and reproductive success, not an account of justice, dignity, or how to arrange a world worth living in. The fact that we treat that mismatch as normal feels like a moral failure to me, and that failure is the starting point for the argument I want to make.

If you want a clear and uncompromising diagnosis of the problem, read David Pearce. He is the British philosopher who made the case publicly for what he calls the Hedonistic Imperative.

The basic claim is straightforward and radical at the same time. Pain, suffering, and negative affect are features of the nervous systems evolution produced. They are not sacred necessities. With the tools of biotechnology, neuropharmacology, and genetic engineering we can change the architecture that gives rise to suffering. Pearce calls for a sustained moral project to do exactly that, aiming ultimately to remove involuntary suffering wherever feasible. He frames this as an engineering challenge and an ethical obligation.

I find Pearce persuasive in a way that is uncomfortable and energizing. I am not attracted to technological novelty for its own sake. What draws me is the ethical clarity. If suffering is something we can reduce without violating other fundamental values, then refusing to try is itself a moral choice. The world we inherit is full of moral blind spots that flow directly from our evolutionary history. Those blind spots are not small or incidental. They shape institutions, markets, and everyday interactions in ways that systematically disadvantage some people and reward others for arbitrary biological luck.

Look at how we treat each other. Taller people, more conventionally attractive people, those with faces and bodies that scream reproductive fitness, tend to be taken more seriously. They get better hiring callbacks, higher status in social settings, more positive assumptions made about their competence. Shorter people, people with nonconforming bodies, those whose faces do not match a narrow ideal, are often overlooked or underestimated. These are not minor social preferences. They cascade into educational opportunities, career paths, and life outcomes. Underneath a lot of what we call merit there is a fog of biological signaling. That fog biases our institutions in ways that reproduce inequality.

Sexual selection amplifies this. Traits that are sexually attractive can become conflated with moral worth, or with leadership credence, or with cultural capital. Social hierarchies form around cues that evolved for mating advantage, not fairness. That skew is quietly powerful. It shapes who gets to be heard, who gets resources, and who gets to set norms. Add to that the brutal facts of predation in the nonhuman world. Predators and prey create systems where suffering is routine and often prolonged. Wild ecosystems are not designed with human moral intuitions in mind. They are the result of blind processes that do not care about pain beyond what affects fitness.

Putting these observations together leads me to a clear moral intuition. If the distribution of dignity, respect, and welfare is significantly influenced by arbitrary biological luck, then we have an obligation to change those structures. That obligation comes in two overlapping registers. One is technological. We should pursue biomedical tools that reduce or remove involuntary suffering. That might look like safer and more targeted pain treatments, neurointerventions that reduce chronic negative affect, or genetic approaches that reduce susceptibility to certain forms of trauma. It might also eventually look like large scale modification of affective systems in ways Pearce sketches, always with strict ethical safeguards.

The other register is social and political. We need to decouple the allocation of respect, resources, and opportunity from crude biological signals. Policies can be rethought so that caregiving, long-term stewardship, and social contribution are rewarded regardless of the biology someone happens to carry. Institutions can be redesigned to account for bias against particular physical characteristics. Cultural practices that unduly weight attractiveness or dominance can be challenged by alternative norms and by structural incentives. In other words, technological interventions and institutional reforms should go together.

This does not mean utopian complacency or an abdication to risk. Pearce himself insists on caution, on the importance of consent, and on the hard ethical work of deciding ends as well as means. I agree with those cautions. Altering hedonic systems will change motivation, tastes, aesthetics, personality structures, and political psychology. There will be winners and losers in different senses, and many of the winners and losers will not be obvious in advance. That demands democratic deliberation, transparency, and robust protections for vulnerable groups. It also demands humility. We should expect mistakes and be ready to correct course.

At the same time, the argument that we should do nothing because we might err is a poor moral excuse for allowing needless suffering to persist. Failure to act is itself a choice with moral consequences. If we can reduce the most intense kinds of suffering in ways that preserve agency and pluralism, then the status quo becomes harder to justify. We should design institutions that minimize coercion and respect individual autonomy, while still aiming at wide distribution of the benefits of any successful interventions.

There is another conclusion I want to state plainly. Once you look closely at nature, the idea that a loving deity is running a moral universe becomes less plausible. Predation, parasites, congenital suffering, and the casual cruelty baked into natural selection do not look like lessons from a benevolent tutor. They look like blind process. Saying this is not an argument for despair. It is an argument for responsibility. If no benevolent hand is steering outcomes, then the burden of care falls to us. That is a heavy burden, and also a clarifying one. It tells us where moral energy should be directed.

I know some readers will find this frightening. Altering minds and bodies sounds like hubris to many. Others will worry about a loss of authenticity or about new forms of inequality. These concerns are real and must be taken seriously. That is why the ethical framework matters as much as the technical possibility. We must insist on democratic governance, on rigorous safety standards, on equitable access, and on a commitment to pluralism about what forms of flourishing people choose. We should also keep a critical eye on motivations. Technology used to entrench privilege or to coerce conformity is a moral disaster. Technology used to expand agency, reduce suffering, and broaden the range of meaningful lives is a moral project I can endorse.

Finally, I want to push back on a subtle but powerful objection: that suffering is somehow morally productive, that it refines character, that hardship yields meaning in ways that technology could inadvertently erase. I take that seriously. The claim that suffering is sometimes connected to meaning does not mean suffering is necessary for meaning. We can imagine and construct forms of challenge, risk, and growth that do not rely on chronic pain or crushing despair. We can preserve narratives of resilience that are not rooted in avoidable harm. This is not an either or. It is about expanding the design space of human life so that meaning and dignity are not purchased with avoidable suffering.

So here is the posture I want to adopt. Treat evolution as history, not moral authority. Read David Pearce and take seriously the Hedonistic Imperative as a spur, not as a dogma. Combine technological ambition with political prudence and ethical humility. Aim to reduce involuntary suffering, and reform our institutions so that biological luck has less sway over who gets dignity and who gets voice. Recognize that nature is not the same thing as the good, and then take responsibility for building something better.

I am not offering a map with a single route. The terrain is complex and contested. I am offering a direction and an insistence. If suffering is, in large part, a historical artifact of blind process, then making it optional is one of the clearest moral tasks available to us. That task requires courage, care, and a willingness to confront uncomfortable truths about who we are and where we came from. It also offers a horizon where dignity is not limited by genetic luck, where the default of life is not suffering, and where our place in the cosmos is one of stewardship rather than resignation.
