excerpt: "WHAT IS THIS BLOG ABOUT, REALLY?"

i'm really glad you were curious enough to end up on my little corner of the internet, well, at least that mostly depends on who you are. anyway, you're probably curious about why i named this blog "axiomatic". i'll give you the reason why. you see, i fundamentally value trying to understand the world through the process of scientific inquiry. i think the first thing any agent or form of intelligence would do when it's randomly thrown into an environment it doesn't understand (as is the case with us) is to inquire and probe things, and i find it rather peculiar when others don't feel the same type of curiosity.

in that process of inquiry, one usually begins by establishing these things called axioms, or assumptions that are unquestionable and solid enough to build arguments and reason from. without the correct axioms, inquiry is nothing but a waste of time.

that's the heart of it. here on axiomatic, i'll be diving into whatever intrigues me enough to inquire about in science, engineering, philosophy, and yeah, even some personal reflections and lessons from my own life. science for me isn't just a bunch of facts stacked up, it's more of an existential imperative for me to figure out how the universe ticks, like the weird stuff in quantum mechanics where particles seem to know what each other are doing from miles away, or the way evolution shapes everything from bugs to brains.

engineering is where the rubber meets the road, taking those wild ideas and turning them into stuff that actually works, think ai that learns like we do or bridges that can withstand earthquakes without breaking a sweat. philosophy ties it all together, making me question the big stuff: what's real knowledge? how do we make ethical choices in a world full of tech? which questions do we even ask? and why do we even bother searching for meaning in all this chaos?

i'll mix in stories from my own experiences too, but forgive me if i'm a little vague in some parts. this isn't an outlet of absolutely everything in my life. in a world drowning in hasty, ragebait-ish takes and endless scrolls, this blog is my shot at slowing down, starting from solid ground, and maybe sparking some curiosity in you too.

if that sounds like your thing, stick around, and lmk what you think of everything (also did you see my 3d model in the about section? shit's cool af)
